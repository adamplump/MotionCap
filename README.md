 Motion Capture System – Concept and Implementation
This project involves the development of a DIY Motion Capture system from scratch, divided into the following stages:

1. System Concept Design – defined the architecture, camera setup, and marker configuration.

2. Calibration and Triangulation Algorithms – implemented custom functions written in MATLAB for multi-camera calibration and 3D point triangulation using the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) method, without relying on built-in MATLAB functions.

3. Marker Tracking – Developed original image processing algorithms for detecting and tracking markers in camera images, based on a Kalman filter, and without using MATLAB's built-in tracking tools.

4. System Accuracy Verification – Evaluated the system's precision using a custom-designed calibration device.
